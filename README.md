# spectral-analysis-of-Malta-s-weather-conditions

The main problem in this project is conducting spectral analysis of temperature data on Malta from 1901 to 2021 in order to identify cycles and dominant frequencies. Spectral analysis will allow extracting information about regular patterns and trends in temperature variability on Malta.
